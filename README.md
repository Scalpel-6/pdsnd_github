### Date created
The bikeshare.py project and this README file were created on 6/27/2024.

### Project Title
Bikeshare.py

### Description
The Bikeshare.py project was inspired by my first attempt to learn Python coding through the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python course.

The concept of the bikeshare.py application is to provide a python script for a user to obtain information from bikeshare usage for three locations: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  The user is prompted to enter the city they would like data, select a month between January and June, and prompted to select a day of the week.  For the time periods, the user can provide input that they would like to see the statistics for all of the months and all of the days of the week.  The recommended month date range is limited to the months between January and June due to the data available.

### Installation and Software 
User needs to have a code editor application and Python installed to run the Bikeshare.py application.  The Bikeshare.py file is located in the current repository with this README.md file.  Within the code editor, the user navigates to the folder where the Bikeshare.py file is stored.  Open an active terminal and type python bikeshare.py in the command line.  The file will open with a welcome message and request user input for the city of choice for data.

### Credits
Much credit is due to Udacity's bikeshare.py template and course instruction.  Without this guidance, the task of creating documentation and python script would be challenging.  I also utilized the Stack Overflow website for additional information on python syntax especially with utilizing pandas.
